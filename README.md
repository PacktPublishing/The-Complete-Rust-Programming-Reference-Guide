# The Complete Rust Programming Reference Guide
This Learning Path is your easy reference to mastering Rust programming. It begins with an introduction to Rust data structures and algorithms and covers the entire spectrum, including memory safety, type system, concurrency, and other features of Rust 2018.


## What you will learn
* Design and implement complex data structures in Rust
* Create and use well-tested and reusable components with Rust
* Understand the basics of multithreaded programming and advanced algorithm design
* Explore application profiling based on benchmarking and testing
* Study and apply best practices and strategies in error handling
* Create efficient web applications with the Actix-web framework
* Use Diesel for type-safe database interactions in your web application




### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher multi-core processor
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 30GB or more
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed:
* Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), arguably one of the best Rust code editors
* Rust support for Visual Studio Code via a plugin (https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode)
* Rust Language Server (RLS), found at https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode, installed via rustup (https://rustup.rs/)
* Debugging support using the LLDB frontend plugin (https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) for Visual Studio Code
